Smile Bank Statement Downloader
===============================

This is a simple extension to help download bank statements from the Smile web client.

When you are visiting a statement page (any account type, including credit cards) it will display an icon in the address bar. By clicking on the icon, all transactions present in the statement will be collected and converted to QIF format. They will then be displayed in a new tab. Save the contents of the new tab into a file on your local hard disk and then import the data via your financial package.

This extension requires permissions to access banking.smile.co.uk and Chrome's tabs API.
